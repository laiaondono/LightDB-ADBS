explanation of your logic for extracting join conditions from the WHERE clause. If this logic is fully explained
in comments in your code, your README does not need to repeat that; however, it must mention exactly where in the
 code/comments the description is, so the grader can find it easily

 explain and provide the location of that code in your readme file (code that extracts join predicates)

any other information you want the grader to know, such as known bugs
